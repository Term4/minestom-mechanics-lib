Simplify this a LOT

blocking modifiers MIGHT be moved to damage / knockback systems

Remove visual effects (other than animation)
keep blockableitem
Basically ALL this system needs to do is state tracking (give blocking tag to players currently blocking, remove it when they stop)
    - Can use a cancellable event node to listen for THE SPECIFIC player that previously was blocking? Might be overkill
Then obviously utilize legacy 1.8 / 1.7 animation fixer
ALSO blocking modifiers (tags)
