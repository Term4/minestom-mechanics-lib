General idea:

compatibility system can have individual aspects turned on / off

components:
    - Hitboxes (1.21 -> 1.8 & 1.8 -> 1.21)
        - bounding box
        - sneak height
        - eye height
    - Poses (can enable / disable different poses)
    - Version detection
    - General compatibility enhancements / fixes
